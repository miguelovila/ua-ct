Given that the Core Timer is a 32-bit timer working on a 20 MHz clock, it means that 1 second corresponds to 20000000 ticks.

If we want a function that delays the program execution by x number of ms, we need to calculate the number of ticks that correspond to 1 ms and multiply it by x.

If 1 second corresponds to 20000000 ticks, then 1 ms corresponds to 20000 ticks, thus the function will be:

void delay(unsigned int ms)
{
    resetCoreTimer();
    while(readCoreTimer() < ms * 20000);
}
