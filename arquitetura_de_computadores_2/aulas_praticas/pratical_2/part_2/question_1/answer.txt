Using only one Core Timer we want to increment 3 variables at different rates: 1 Hz, 5 Hz and 10 Hz.

Since 10 Hz is the fastest, we will use it as the base rate. We will use the 5 Hz and 1 Hz rates as multiples of the 10 Hz rate.

The 10 Hz rate is 100 ms, so we will use the 100 ms Core Timer to increment the 10 Hz variable. The 5 Hz rate is 200 ms, so we will use the 200 ms Core Timer to increment the 5 Hz variable. The 1 Hz rate is 1000 ms, so we will use the 1000 ms Core Timer to increment the 1 Hz variable.
