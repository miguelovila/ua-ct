## (a i) What is the purpose of the pattern #ifndef #define in linked-list.h file?

```cpp
#ifndef __SO_IPC_ULL_
#define __SO_IPC_ULL_
```

The previous code is a preprocessor directive in C++ code. Specifically, it is an include guard that prevents the same header file from being included multiple times in the same translation unit. The ifndef directive checks if the macro _SO_IPC_ULL has not been defined yet. If it has not been defined, the code between the ifndef and the corresponding endif directive will be included in the translation unit. Otherwise, the code will be skipped.

Include guards are important because including the same header file multiple times can lead to errors such as redefinition of symbols and increased compilation time. By using include guards, we ensure that the header file is only included once, even if it is included in multiple source files.

The macro name _SO_IPC_ULL is a unique identifier that should not conflict with any other macro defined in the codebase. It is common practice to use a naming convention that includes the name of the header file to ensure uniqueness.

## (a ii) All of linked-list module functions have a Node* first argument. Why?

The Node* argument in all of the functions in the linked-list module represents the head of the linked list. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The head of the linked list is a pointer to the first node in the sequence.

By passing the head of the linked list as an argument to each function, the functions can access and manipulate the nodes in the linked list. For example, the append function adds a new node to the end of the linked list by traversing the list from the head to the last node, and then adding the new node as the next node of the last node. Similarly, the remove function removes a node from the linked list by traversing the list from the head to the node to be removed, and then updating the pointers of the previous and next nodes to bypass the node to be removed.

## (a iii) The linked-list module functions are defined within a namespace, named base. Is there any advantage in doing so?

Yes, there are advantages to defining the linked-list module functions within a namespace.

Namespaces are used to group related code together and avoid naming conflicts with other code. By defining the linked-list module functions within the "base" namespace, it helps to organize the code and make it easier to understand and maintain.

Additionally, namespaces can help to avoid naming conflicts with other code that may be included in the project. By using a unique namespace, it reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts with other code that may be using the same function or variable names.

Overall, using namespaces is a good practice in C++ programming, as it helps to organize and modularize code, and avoid naming conflicts.
